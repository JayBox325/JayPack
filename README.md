## Setup

## Config

## Commands

There are three commands to run for this boilerplate as follows:

* `npm start` - this will compile everything then start watching all the source files.
* `npm build` - this builds all your source files, but still in your development environment so sourcemaps will be included and nothing will be minified.
* `npm package` - this is the command for pushing code live. This will remove all the sourcemaps and minify everything ready for launch.
